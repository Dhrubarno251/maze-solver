# Requirements for Maze Solver Game (C Project)

# This project is written in C, so it doesn't require Python packages.
# However, here are the tools and libraries needed to compile and run it.

# C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
gcc

# Windows-specific libraries (included in Windows OS)
conio.h
windows.h

# For cross-platform support, these libraries may need to be replaced with:
# ncurses (Linux)
# stdlib.h and termios (for input handling on Unix-like systems)

# Optional tools for enhancement (GUI, graphics, etc.)
# SDL2
# ncurses
